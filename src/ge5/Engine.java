// As the main engine class, this should set up the Canvas & Frame 
// via the screen class and host the main game loop.

// The main game loop should call the following abstract methods:
// init -- Called at the beginning of the constructor to initialize game options (eg. fixed tick rate, Window title ...)
// start -- Called before the first tick is called
// fixedTick -- called at a set rate, used for updating input and physics.
// tick -- Called as soon as the previous render completes includes a delta parameter that represents time since last tick
// render -- Called after tick, managed by render class
